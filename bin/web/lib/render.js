// Polled UIs clobber open dropdowns, focused inputs, and text selections when

 *     EARLIER pending flush is dropped with it (a build captured before this sig
 *     is stale);
 *   - skip while a control inside `host` is focused (select/input/textarea/
 *     contenteditable) — an open dropdown must not snap shut;
 *   - skip while a popover or <dialog> inside `host` is open — a swap would
 *     destroy it mid-use;
 *   - skip while a text selection TOUCHES `host` — starting or ending inside it,
 *     lying within it, or merely spanning it (see selectionInside);
 *   - otherwise replaceChildren(build()).
 * `build` only runs when we actually swap, so a skipped tick is cheap. A swap
 * deferred by focus/overlay/selection flushes the INSTANT that condition
 * clears — one listener set armed per host (focusout / toggle+close+removal
 * observer / selectionchange), not a wait for the next poll tick, so a quiet
 * SSE stream or a one-shot store-triggered render can't strand stale DOM (#42).
 * Never advance `sig` on a skip (handled here: sig is only recorded when
 * swapping). `force:true` swaps unconditionally and clears any pending flush
 * for `host`.
 *
 * Sig hygiene: `sig` is a cheap string of exactly what this region renders.
 * A fast-ticking value must never share a sig with an O(content) region —
 * give it its own region or mutate it in place.
 *
 * `defer:false` picks the other deferral strategy: report the hold and let the
 * CALLER retry, arming nothing and recording nothing. For an app that already
 * lands held renders through its own tick-retry flag — because its keyed lists
 * and in-place updaters must re-derive from live state rather than replay a
 * captured build — this is how it shares canon's definition of "held" instead of
 * reimplementing the predicates (#72, docs/adr/0002). Pick one strategy per host;
 * a `defer:false` call drops any self-flush an earlier `defer:true` call left
 * armed. Note that disowning happens HERE, on the call — so a host this module
 * has ever deferred must keep coming through `renderRegion` (with `defer:false`)
 * rather than being skipped by a bare `heldInside` early return, which cannot
 * reach the pending entry.

 * @param {() => Node} build
 * @param {{ sig?: string, force?: boolean, defer?: boolean }} [opts]

 * value is "held" rather than "swapped", so a `while (held) retry` loop
 * terminates. Because the sig gate runs first, `true` means a swap really is owed
